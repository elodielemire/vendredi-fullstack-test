# Vendredi chatX application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Exercice

Create a real time chat where the user can :
- Read the last 10 messages of the chat when he enters
- Read the new messages of the other users 
- Write and send new messages to the other users

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

\
In a new terminal you can run :
### `cd sse-server`
Then :
### `node server.js`
And start sending messages on the chat :)

## Improvements
- Add a view to enter the name of the user instead of generating a random Id
- Test it
